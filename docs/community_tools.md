## JAAG: a JSON input file Assembler for AlphaFold 3 (with Glycan Integration)

JAAG is a lightweight, web-based GUI tool that helps generate AlphaFold 3 input JSON files with integrated glycan support. It automates the creation of correct glycan syntax (including `bondedAtomPairs` + CCD), reducing manual errors when preparing glycoprotein or glycan–protein complexes.

Note: JAAG is compatible with standalone AlphaFold 3, but not with the AlphaFold
3 server.

## Modeling glycans with AlphaFold 3: capabilities, caveats, and limitations

We would like to share our recent work on modeling glycans (and other ligands) with AF3. We modeled and assessed major glycan classes and provided practical resources:
*   Step-by-step tutorial for building ligand inputs (applicable beyond glycans)
*   Ready-to-run scripts for each glycan class
*   Comprehensive CCD table for all SNFG monosaccharides
*   Discussion of caveats and limitations of AF3
*   Full AF3 inputs/outputs openly archived on ModelArchive for reproducibility

If your AF3 ligand models appear stereochemically off, give it another try!
